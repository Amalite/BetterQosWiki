# Welcome to the Advanced Guide! {#Intro}
This is meant to act as a guide for **more skilled** modelers, looking to learn some extra tips and tricks to make models better and more easily.

It's recommended to make a couple models of your own through the steps provided in the [Starter Guide](/StarterGuide/StarterIntro) before trying things gone over here.
