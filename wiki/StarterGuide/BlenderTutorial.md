# Navigating around Blender can be confusing, thankfully, it's not that hard! {#Intro}
Here is where you'll learn the basics of how to navigate around Blender. You won't learn how to do everything here, just what you need to know to properly get to creating your model!

::: info :speech_balloon: NOTE
If you already know how to use Blender, you can [skip this step](/StarterGuide/ModelCreation).

## Selecting Objects and Moving Your View {#Navigation}
Use **Left Click** to select objects and move **Gizmos** in your scene. **Middle Click** (Also known as pressing down the scroll wheel) to rotate, pan (while holding **Shift**) and zoom (while holding **Ctrl**)! And finally, **Right Click** to open your **context menu**! Context Menus are a list of options to choose from based on what you ***currently have selected***.

## Gizmos
Gizmos are tools you can use within your scene to **translate, rotate, and scale** the objects within your scene, so let's get started with introducing ourselves to them! To access your tools, click on their respective icons on the left (or press **Shift + Space** to open up the tools list)!

## Move

This is the **Move Gizmo**, you can use the **arrows** to move your object around the **3 axes**, the **squares** to move your object along one of the 3 **planes**, or the **white circle** to move around on all **3 axes at once**!!

## Rotate

With the **Rotate Gizmo**, you can use the **rings** rotate your object around the **3 axes**, the **white ring** to rotate around **your view**, or **anywhere inside the ring** to rotate around **all 3 axes** at once!

## Scale

Using the **Scale Gizmo**, you can change the size of your selected object with the **3 lines** to do so along **an axis**, the squares to scale the object across the **3 planes**, or the **white circle** to scale the entire object across **all 3 axes** at once!

## Viewport Shading
Often times you'll find you'll need to look at your model from **different types of views**, or simply want to see what your model will look like **before you render**. Thankfully, switching between your views is easy! Just click one of the **4 spheres** to change your **viewport shading mode**! We'll go over what each one looks like in order, from left to right:

## Wireframe
<p>
Wireframe, being the first sphere, lets you see your objects as a bunch of <b>lines</b> connecting your <b>vertices</b> together. By default, <b>X-Ray</b> <input type="image" src="/BetterQosWiki/images/Wireframe Icon.png" width="25" disabled alt="Wireframe Icon"/> is turned on in this mode, letting you see what's behind your objects!

## Solid Color

Solid Color is the default view mode when you open Blender on a new file, and lets you see your objects all in a solid color with basic lighting! you can change the appearance of your objects in the dropdown menu **beside your viewport modes**.

## Material Preview

In Material Preview, your objects will use the materials you've applied to them, **though without any lighting**. This can be good for shading (also known as putting materials on your objects), as you can get a general idea of what your object will look in a **completely lit area**.

## Render Preview

Render Preview, also known as Rendered View, applies the materials you have on your objects as well as the lights within your scene. Useful for setting up lights within your scene, or simply checking to see how your scene looks before you render!

## Properties
To make any specific changes to your object as a whole, such as transform it or apply **modifiers**, you'll need to use the **Properties** window. We won't be going over the specifics of it here, though you can click around the various options and menus and try things out for yourself!

Once you've gotten accustomed to using Blender, you're ready to start [making some models](/StarterGuide/ModelCreation)!
