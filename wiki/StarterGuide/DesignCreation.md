title: Creating a Design

# Woah there, before you get started 3D modeling the saber of your dreams, you need to figure out what you want to make first!

It's easy to get ahead of yourself when it comes to modeling, but you'll often have ideas all over the place, which makes it **hard to stick to a design or theme**. If you don't have a *clear focus* on the look and style you want your saber to be, then you'll might just slap everything that looks cool in, which just makes the whole thing look ***terrible***!

In order to keep your thoughts organized while making your model, it's recommended to **come up with a design first!** Here we'll go over the basic key things to think about when designing.

## Saber, Block, or Wall?
Starting off small, ***what kind of model do you want to make?*** A **Wall** to add to the rare few that get made? A **Block** for people to hit? Your very own **Saber** to enjoy? Choosing may be easy for some, but for those who just want to get their creative hands dirty, it can be more complex of an answer than you think!

## What will the model's shape be?
Be sure to check the [different types of sabers and blocks](/StarterGuide/ModelTypes.md) page of the wiki to learn what kind of shapes Sabers and Blocks will be, and choose one that you want to make! This will be a ***core aspect*** of the appearance of your model, so choose carefully!

## What theme or style do you want your model to fit in?
**This can be anything!** They can be futuristic, dark and sinister, or even funny or cute! Once you have a certain theme picked out, **try to base everything ahead** off of this theme. 
- You don't want to have a high-tech saber have a picture of a dinosaur on the side of it, *that just wouldn't make sense with the theme!*

## To particle or not to particle?
**Do you want to use particles with parts of the saber, such as the blade?** This can wildly change the look of the saber, making it look much more like the blade is made of **pure energy or fire**!

## What goes around the saber?
Do you want a ring that goes around the saber? Or perhaps a ring of text that has your name on it? **You don't have to have something around the saber**, but doing so can add onto what's already there, making the saber look much *cooler!*

## What is your model going to look like when it's finished?
This step might be the trickiest of them all if you **aren't good at drawing**, but make a ***couple sketches as to what you want your model to look like!*** Be sure to draw sketches from **different perspectives** (top, side, orthographic, etc), to give yourself a good idea *in the future* of how it's going to look!
- Getting your ideas onto paper or in drawing apps like MSPaint ***is much better*** than keeping them all in your head, so this step is **important** to do so you don't change anything **major** on accident while you're modeling!
- Be sure to leave notes so future you doesn't forget!

Be sure to fit **every** detail you want in your model when drawing! It helps you figure out what would look good and what wouldn't. Not everything fits together perfectly!
