# What is Unity and why do I need to use it?
Unity is a game engine that almost ***a million*** games are made with, one of these games being **Beat Saber**. Due to the acute nature of Unity and Beat Saber Modding, models would **need to be exported as an acceptable format that Unity, as a game engine, can read** to be able to be used. The only way to do this is to export sabers **through the game engine itself**, specifically on the ***same version*** of Unity Beat Saber was made with.

## How do I get Unity?
First thing's first, it's recommended to get [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download), as it helps you get, and manage, multiple versions of Unity, as well as different projects.

Once you get Unity Hub installed, open it up and make a new account for Unity if you haven't before *(or just sign in if you have)*, and be sure to avoid installing any versions of Unity it recommends you. Chances are, you wouldn't be needing them!

Next up, you might get an alert at the top of the window alerting you that you **don't have an active license**, but don't worry! This will only take a few seconds to fix, first, go to preferences **(the gear icon!)**, then click "Licenses", from there, just click "Add", and then "Get a free personal license", confirm the terms and conditions and boom! You have yourself a Unity Personal License!

::: info :speech_balloon: NOTE
You can also click the button on the top right reading "Manage Licenses" from the alert box!

## Installing the right version of Unity
Once you have Unity Hub set up, you're ready to install Unity! **Be careful though**, you can't just install any version of Unity! You need a specific version called **2019.3.2f1**, don't forget it!

If you ever clicked "Install Editor", you'll have noticed that this ***special*** version of Unity doesn't appear here! The reason is because Unity Hub typically only shows it's latest versions of Unity straight from the app, with 2019.3.2f1 being what's called a **LTS**, or Long-Term Support version of Unity, which you will have to get off of Unity's website from [here](https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive). 
- Just click **"Unity 2019.X"**, then scroll down until you see **"2019.3.2"**, and then click **"Unity Hub"**, which will open Unity Hub for you to install that version of Unity!

Once you confirm that you clicked on the right version of Unity in Unity Hub *(Look at the top left of the window that popped up!)*, be sure to check the boxes for **"Android Build Support"**, as without it, you **wouldn't be able to export** your sabers to for Quest!

After you continue and accept the terms and conditions, all that's left is to wait for Unity to download and install!
::: warning  :warning: WARNING
 If you chose to also include **Microsoft Visual Studio** in the installation, then you might have to go through a separate installation process.
 
 **You do not need to install Microsoft VS to make sabers,** but if you want to [make your own **shaders**](/WIP), you can use **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).**

Once it's done installing, you're ready to open the [Qosmetics Project](/WIP) and get started on turning your model into a saber, cube, or wall!
