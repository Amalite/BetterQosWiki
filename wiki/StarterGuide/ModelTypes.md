# There's types of Sabers?!?
There sure is! Each saber and block type is designed to fit various playstyles and personal preferences, they're not all like the official sabers!


## Types of Sabers
### Default
Defaults are sabers that have the same shape as the vanilla sabers, having the same width, from start to end, like a baton you pass in a race!

### Needle
Needles are sabers that start wide, but get thinner towards the end of the saber, like a needle for sewing!

### Thin
Thin sabers are thinner than usual the default thickness, usually to reduce how much the sabers block your view when playing!
::: info :speech_balloon: NOTE
Thin sabers can also be Needles, in which case the needles will be thinner than normal too!

### Blade
Blades are a term to define any saber that are swords, like katanas!

::: danger :no_entry: WIP
An image is supposed to go here, but Amalien didn't make a sword yet.

Take this picture of a ***very small*** **Plasma Katana** as a temporary replacement until Amalien or someone else makes a blade to use as an example

### Baton
Batons are sabers that have a large handle, then suddenly become thin for the rest of the saber, like baton weapons!

## Types of Blocks

### Standard
Standard Blocks are blocks that have an identical shape to the default blocks seen in vanilla!

### Precision
Precision Blocks are much like standard blocks, but have a line or dot going right through the center, giving you a ruler to guide your sabers through when swinging!
