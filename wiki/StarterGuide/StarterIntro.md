# Welcome to the Starter Guide! {#Intro}
If you're new to modeling, and don't know what to do, you've come to the right place!

You'll first need to know the [terminology of a modeler](/StarterGuide/Terms.md), then, you'll need to know what you'll need in order to make your very own models for Qosmetics!

## Unity
Beat Saber is a game made in Unity, so if you want to make anything for it, like models that are used with Qosmetics (or Custom Models for 1.40.6+!), then that means you'll need to get your hands dirty with Unity as well! You can learn about installing **the right version** of Unity [here](/StarterGuide/InstallUnity).

## 3D Modeling Software

How are you going to make models without 3D Modeling Software? Applications like **Blender** or **Autodesk Maya** are *essential* to have in any modeler's toolkit. Without them, you won't be able to create your masterpiece!

The best (and free) option of them all is **Blender**, which you can download from [here](https://www.blender.org/download/), or, if you have Steam installed on your computer, and always want the latest versions of Blender, you can download the Steam version from [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/365670/Blender/).

Once you have both Unity and the 3D Software of your choice installed and set up, you can go onto using the [Qosmetics Unity Project](/WIP)!
