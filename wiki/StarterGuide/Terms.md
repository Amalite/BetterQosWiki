# CC? Bloom? What do those mean?
Modelers and posts of custom models use a variety of terms that can be confusing to a newcomer, as well as anyone not looking to make their own custom models. Thankfully, this page is here to define what these puzzling words mean!

### Custom Colors (Also known as CC
CC, or Custom Colors, are the colors of the sabers, blocks, and walls that you can change in-game, you can find (and change!) your Custom Colors in the Player Options tab.
- If a custom model say it supports CC or Custom Colors, then that means parts of the saber will change color to match what you have set in your settings!

::: info :speech_balloon: NOTE
Ignore the **Sabers(SF)** option if you play on Quest! This is for Saber Factory, a custom saber mod for ***PC Only***, which is in itself it's own separate mod apart from Qosmetics that we aren't going over.

### Custom Trail
Custom Trail means the trail of the saber is different from the original trail used in the vanilla game.
- Typically, **every** saber has a custom trail, and while you can't change texture of the trail in-game, you can, however, change how white the trail is by adjusting the **Whitestep** value in the Qosmetics settings.

### ScreenSpace
ScreenSpace is used to define textures that are "detached" from the model itself, seeming much more like the model in which it uses a ScreenSpace material as a ***window*** into a space where only the texture exists, moving where this ***"window"*** is changes what part of the texture is visible.

### Bloom
Bloom is the glow a material emits. Bloom is dynamic, and looks better compared to Fake Glow.
- Bloom is automatically on in **PC Beat Saber**, but if you want to get Bloom on your Quest, you will need to have the mod [AnyTweaks](https://github.com/BunniKaitlyn/AnyTweaks) installed, and have the option for bloom turned on in the mod's settings.

### Fake Glow
Fake Glow is a particle aura that goes around the model to give the illusion of Bloom's glow, without actually being glow itself
- You don't need any mods to see Fake Glow, but often it is found that Fake Glow works **worse** compared to Bloom, even if Bloom does impact performance.
